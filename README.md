This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:

The first option gives the user the option to add a car's year, make, and model to the file My_old_cars
The second option gives the user the option to view the cars they put in the My_old_cars file
The 3rd option gives the user the option to exit the program and get told goodbye
